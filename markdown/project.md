# 1: Project Proposal

## Overview

You are to propose a __problem__ and an __approach__ that could form the basis
of a project for this course. Successful projects will observe the need for good
human-centered design in an interactive computing system, analyze the needs and
opportunities in the problem, explore potential designs, and propose a
compelling solution.


### Project Theme

The theme for projects in this course is __self-tracking and everyday
interaction with personal data__.

People have long sought to better understand themselves, but continuing
technology advances enable new approaches. Students will examine problems people
encounter in gathering and gaining value from personal data, then explore how
design insights can help go beyond simple data fetishes to support people in
using personal data as part of reaching their goals.

Understanding and designing for self-tracking is also known as personal
informatics:

"Personal informatics systems are systems that help people collect personally
relevant information for the purpose of self-reflection and gaining
self-knowledge. " by [[Li et al.,2010](https://doi.org/10.1145/1753326.1753409)]

Self-tracking and personal informatics are related to the [Quantified
Self](http://quantifiedself.com/) movement, which describes itself as:

"Self-knowledge through numbers." by [[Wolf, 2010](https://archive.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/17-07/lbnp_knowthyself)]

Instead of limiting self-tracking to dashboards for an isolated self-analyst,
consider the many different ways people might gather and interact with personal
data, and how they might gain meaningful value from these activities.

Tracking can therefore take many forms:

- wearable sensors
- phone and watch applications
- appliances and other artifacts in the environment
- hybrid and multi-device forms (e.g., mobile capture with later annotation or
  review)

Tracking can include many social contexts:

- people seeking help from peers (e.g., social sharing, support networks)
- people seeking help from experts (e.g., health providers)
- co-located relationships (e.g., families, friends, co-workers)
- remote relationships (e.g., families, friends, co-workers)
- communities organizing (e.g., people in a building, community volunteers)

Tracking can explore new forms of interaction:

- conversational interfaces
- tangible interfaces
- ubiquitous computing interfaces
- artificial intelligence

Any problem where people gather or seek value in personal data introduces
opportunities and challenges in designing for effective interaction around that
data.

### Thinking Big

Your proposal must go beyond a technology-centric proposal of a website, phone
application, or interaction. Instead think about the problems that people face
in their lives, how we can approach those problems, and the role for interactive
computing. This first assignment is your opportunity to think broadly about
identifying a problem. Subsequent assignments will provide opportunities to
focus on designing a specific technological solution to a specific set of tasks.

You should identify and consider goals and activities that are important to
people. Potential domains include:

 - living a healthy life
 - managing finances effectively
 - managing time effectively
 - reducing environmental impact

Activities within personal informatics can include:

 - planning to track
 - helping remember to track
 - the actual act of tracking
 - identifying activity patterns
 - sharing accomplishments with friends and family
 - deciding to abandon tracking

Do not start with a focus on concrete one-time tasks (e.g., logging into your
bank account). Instead identify problems in long-lived activities that span many
different social or technological contexts. If you want to help people manage
their money, do not immediately propose a website that addresses one specific
task. Instead consider the range of other opportunities (e.g., personal mobile
devices, shared family computers, point of sale systems).

Focus on creating or improving a specific application or service that addresses
the issues of specific people. Design is rarely for "everybody", but instead
generally more compelling with a more clear focus. You must be able to create
and evaluate a design within the time frame of this course, so consider whether
you can reasonably gain access to the necessary people.

We encourage you to think big, expanding your thinking to include new ideas for
interaction techniques or technology platforms. Do not feel constrained by
current devices or immediate implementation, but instead aim to explore an
exciting design that could potentially motivate the development of new enabling
technology.

Finally, the project theme requires your proposal present some opportunity for
__self-tracking and everyday interaction with personal data__. But you will
ultimately follow your design process where it leads you, which may or may not
emphasize self-tracking or personal data. Focusing on problems and
opportunities, rather than specific design features, will leave room for your
design to emerge and be refined in the course of this project.

## Milestones and Deliverables

This is an individual assignment, consisting of three milestones.

### Assignment 1.A: Ideation of potential projects

The goal of this milestone is to help get you started in thinking of some ideas
for a potential projects. 

Propose three starting points for brainstorming domains, problems, and goals
that might be supported via self-tracking.

By domain, we mean an aspect of life. Domains that are already common in
self-tracking include:

- finances (e.g., tracking spending, a budget, investments)
- wellness (e.g., tracking physical activity, sleep, weight)
- health (e.g., tracking for post-surgical pain management, allergies or other
  personal triggers, major weight loss)
- mood (e.g., tracking mood, identifying depressive symptoms)

Be sure to focus on problems and goals, not potential design solutions. One way
to help yourself identify a hierarchy of problems and goals is to ask "Why?".
For example:

- Why is a person using a budgeting app?
- Why is a person tracking their spending?
- Why do they want to know how much they spend on leisure activities?
- Why do they have a goal of saving for a major purchase?

Each idea should be just a sentence or two, identifying the domain and the
problem, goal, or idea.

Your ideas must be significantly different, not small variations on the same
idea.

- At most one of your ideas may come from any of the domains above.
- Your other two ideas should come from two domains that are not in the above
  list and are different from each other.

#### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format.

Submit via your git repository.

#### In Class

Be prepared to contribute your initial ideas as part of a larger brainstorm.

Bring a printed copy of your submission, or otherwise have it readily available
(e.g., as a photo on your phone).

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __3 points__:

1. __Each Unique Proposed Idea__: (3 x 1 point)

   Do not submit small variations on the same idea.

   Do not submit ideas within an excluded topic.

   Be clear why each idea is potentially related to the course theme.

   At most one of your ideas may come from the domains listed above (i.e.,
   finances, wellness, health, mood).

   Be clear regarding the domain of each idea, ensure each idea is from a
   different domain.

### Assignment 1.B: Problem Proposal

The goal of this milestone is to propose multiple specific problems that could
form the basis of a design project for this class.

Propose three specific problems that are potentially related to the course theme
and could form the basis of a design project for this class.

For each problem, in one paragraph, describe the design problem and motivation.
This description should convince the reader that this is a difficult and
interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering. State what the
problem is and why it is a problem, or describe a new idea and why it will
enhance an existing application or practice.

Ensure each problem or idea is significantly different, not small variations on
the same problem or idea.

Ensure it is clear why each problem or idea is potentially related to the course
theme.

If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your proposed
problem, explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may
explore a different approach.

After receiving critique on TBA, update your proposals ahead of additional
critique on TBA.

As part of prompting you to deeply engage with and consider critique,
your submitted revision must completely modify at least one of your original
ideas
(e.g., replacing at least one idea with a completely different idea,
completely re-writing an idea to emphasize a different perspective).

#### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format.

- After receiving critique on TBA, submit an updated version. In the same
  additional separate PDF as your Contribution Statement, also provide a brief
  explanation of revisions (e.g., one paragraph on what you revised, why you
  revised it).

Submit via your git repo.

#### In Class

Be prepared to discuss your three proposed problems.

Bring several printed copies of your submission,
so you can easily share them with peers for critique.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __10 points__:

1. __Problem and Motivation for Each Unique Proposed Idea__: (3 x 2 points)

   Do not submit small variations on the same idea.

   Do not submit ideas within an excluded topic.

   Be clear why each idea is potentially related to the course theme.

   Completely modify at least one idea as part of revision after initial critique.

2. __Novelty and Creativity__: (2 points)

   If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your proposed problem,
   explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.

3. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

   In the same additional separate PDF as your Contribution Statement,
   also provide a brief explanation of revisions (e.g., one paragraph on what you revised, why you revised it).

We will primarily grade the revised version of your submission,
but may also apply a penalty if the original submission was severely underdeveloped or otherwise problematic.

### Assignment 1.C: Problem Proposal and Analysis

The goal of this milestone is to propose and analyze a problem that will form
the basis of a design project for this class. You should build upon the feedback
you have received from peers and course staff. Although your project will
iterate and evolve from this point, your group should have coalesced around an
idea.

In one paragraph, describe the design problem and motivation. State what the
problem is and why it is a problem, or describe a new idea and why it will
enhance an existing application or practice. Provide enough detail to convince
the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a
quarter considering.

In another paragraph, analyze the problem or idea to give more background and
context to convey how your project might evolve to be compelling. Do not just
focus on the negative aspects of the current situation, but also identify some
positive aspects that may be beneficial to retain. A few salient examples from
existing systems or practices could be used to support those claims. If
appropriate, you may conduct this analysis by describing a scenario that
illustrates how someone might encounter and resolve the problem.

If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your proposed
problem, explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may
explore a different approach.

#### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format.

Submit via your git repo.

#### Grading

Submitting a finalized project proposal as part of a group is a requirement for proceeding in the class.

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __10 points__:

1. __Problem and Motivation__: (3 points)

   Provide enough detail to convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering.

2. __Analysis of Problem__: (3 points)

   Give enough background and context to convey how your project might evolve to be compelling.

3. __Novelty and Creativity__: (2 points)

   If there are already well-known and widely-available solutions to your proposed problem,
   explain how these existing solutions fall short or suggest how you may explore a different approach.

4. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

# 2: Getting the Right Design

## Overview

Even when a problem is well-motivated, understanding that problem and choosing a
design to pursue is a difficult process. This group assignment, spanning
multiple weeks of the course, tackles the problem of selecting the right design
through __design research__, __task development__, __generating multiple
potential designs__, and finally __selecting a design__ to pursue.

## Milestones and Deliverables

This is a group assignment, consisting of eight milestones.

### Assignment 2.A: Planning Design Research

The goal of this milestone is to begin thinking about how to plan effective
design research to inform your design process.

Generate 10 different ideas related to each of the following aspects of your
project proposal:

- Forms: types of technology on which a design might be developed (e.g.,
  wearable sensors, watch/phone/tablet, desktop, appliances or other artifacts
  in the environment).
- Data: types of data a design might track or help a person track.
- Tasks: what a person might accomplish with a design.
- Features: a specific capability a design might have.
- Social Interactions: types of social interactions and situations a design
  might engage or support.

We will provide sheets of paper to help structure this brainstorm. Sketch your
ideas, one in each square. Each idea should be either a quick doodle with a
caption or a one-sentence idea. A person familiar with your project but not in
your group should be able to understand the idea each sketch conveys.

The goal is to begin exploring the space of possibilities, not attempting to
polish some individual possibility. Focus on the quantity of ideas, not the
quality of any one idea. You may include ideas from existing products, but no
two ideas should be alike. When you get stuck, find a context to inspire new
ideas.

After this brainstorming, you will have a broad space of possible directions.
Your project will soon need to gather information on how to generate and
consider ideas in such directions. Following up on the above, additionally
brainstorm:

- People: types of people you might work with to learn more about problems and
  opportunities.
- Focus: what parts of the problems and opportunities you might focus on
  learning more about.
- Method: how you might engage those people to learn more about problems and
  opportunities.

#### Submission and Grading

Submit this via your git repo.

### Assignment 2.B: Initial plan for design research

The goal of this milestone is to develop an initial plan for your design
research, encouraging you to work through details of how you would conduct that
research and improving those details through critique and peer feedback.

As part of Assignment 2, you are required to conduct design research (e.g.,
contextual inquiry, interviews, observations) to learn from at least __three__
people who might use your design.

In one paragraph, describe the people who might use your design. If other people
are also likely impacted by a design, also describe these other stakeholders to
consider. Among potential stakeholders, describe the __participants__ you plan
to pursue, including such details as their background and the environment where
you will examine their current practices.

- For example, your target participants should not be "doctors" but instead a
  specific group of doctors (e.g., Family Practitioners in the UW Roosevelt
  Clinic). Other stakeholders might include patients of the clinic, nurses in
  the clinic, or non-medical staff in the clinic.

Describe your __recruitment plan__ in enough detail to convince us that you can
find and engage with your target participants in the next week. Whether you
intend to target participants that are relatively difficult to access (e.g., as
with busy doctors) or more readily available (e.g., undergraduate students at
the Augusta University), describe your planned recruitment activities, and when
you will be conducting your design research, being as specific as possible.
Additionally describe any steps you have already taken to recruit, and your
plans to recover if recruitment is not initially successful in the necessary
timeline.

In another paragraph, describe the __specific design research method(s)__ you
will use to engage with and learn from these people and your rationale for
choosing these method(s). A typical expected method would be contextual inquiry
with three participants. However, we encourage you to propose alternative or
additional design research methods according to your needs (e.g., you are
welcome but not required to propose to combine multiple methods). Please be as
specific as possible, providing relevant details for you proposed methods. For
example:

- If you propose contextual inquiries, discuss current behaviors you want to
  observe and your planned focus.
- If you propose interviews, discuss the types of questions you plan to explore.
- If you propose a diary study, discuss what type of data you plan to ask
  participants to bring or collect.

On a second page, provide more detail regarding your primary proposed method.
For example:

- If you propose contextual inquiries, enumerate what activities you intend to
  observe, what focus you intend to bring to observation of each activity, and
  any strategies you intend to pursue for gaining insight through your
  observations.
- If you propose interviews, give an example set of planned talking points.
- If you propose a diary study, give details of what and how you will ask
  participants to diary.

#### Submission

No more than two pages of text in PDF format.

Submit via your git repo.

#### In Class

Be prepared to discuss your design research plan.

Bring several printed copies of your submission (e.g., four),
so that you can easily present them to peers for critique.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __9 points__:

1. __Overall Feasibility and Specificity of People and Recruitment Plan__: (3
   points)

   Describe stakeholders and participants.

   Describe recruitment plan.

   Describe any steps already taken and plans to recover if recruitment is not
   initially successful.

2. __Overall Feasibility and Specificity of Design Research Methods__: (2
   points)

   Describe your specific design research method(s) and your rationale for
   choosing these method(s).

3. __Primary Method Details__: (2 points)

   Provide sufficient details of your primary method to support critique of
   those details.

4. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

### Assignment 2.C: Starting your design research

The goal of this milestone is to begin your design research, reflect on what you
observe and learn, then update your plans for additional design research.

Complete design research with at least one participant prior to this check-in.
You hopefully learned something about the needs of people who might use your design,
but also about effectively conducting your design research.

Describe your first design research participant and your findings:

- What did you do?
  - Who you observed or interviewed, their relevant background or context.
- What did you learn?
  - List **six** specific findings based on what you observed or learned.
  - For example, what specific tasks, problems, or opportunities did you
    uncover?

We expect findings will be short but concrete. For example, findings might be
organized as a bulleted list, where each bullet starts with a bolded summary of
the finding and then shares a participant quote or researcher observation that
informed that finding.

Then discuss what remains to be pursued in your additional design research. We
fully expect changes will be necessary, as design research can be difficult to
get right and often important topics are left unresolved.

- Did you encounter any difficulties establishing rapport or getting the
  information you need?
- What are your plans for the remaining participants?
- How do you plan to change your design research plan based on what you learned
  with your first participant?

#### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format.

Submit via your git repo.

#### In Class

Be prepared to discuss your design research.

Bring several printed copies of your submission (e.g., four),
so that you can easily present them to peers for critique.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __8 points__:

1. __Description of Participant__: (1 point)
2. __Specific Findings__: (6 x .5 points)
3. __Plan for Remaining Participants__: (2 points)

Discuss what remains to be pursued, any challenges encountered, and your updated
design research plan.

4. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

### Assignment 2.D: Reflection on your design research

The goal of this milestone is to reflect on what you observed and learned in
your design research, organizing observations around themes and developing
insights into tasks that can help inform your design.

#### Identifying Themes

Complete design research with a total of at least three participants. Discuss
your process and what you learned:

- What did you do?
  - Who you observed or interviewed, their relevant background or context.
- What did you learn?
  - List **at least eight** specific findings based on what you observed or
    learned.
  - For example, what specific tasks, problems, or opportunities did you
    uncover?

We expect findings will be short but concrete. For example, findings might be
organized as a bulleted list, where each bullet starts with a bolded summary of
the finding and then shares a participant quote or researcher observation that
informed that finding.

Although you now have more participants, this milestone asks for relatively few
additional findings. We expect you will curate your findings (e.g., to focus on
those which are most interesting, to convey the range of things you learned, to
emphasize key themes you have identified). Some of your specific findings
therefore might also have been reported in Assignment 2.C, but others will be
new and the overall set will be curated with a focus on advancing your project.

Across your participants, we expect some emergence of common themes, problems,
and practices.

- Identify at least two themes or high-level insights that are suggested by your
  findings across multiple participants.
- Do your findings, themes, and problems suggest tasks that are important to
  design for?

If you are having trouble identifying high-level themes, problems, and design
opportunities, it may indicate a need to develop additional understanding
through more design research. Because your findings at this point are critical
to setting a foundation for your project, ensure your design research has
provided you the insights and perspective you need to proceed.

#### Task Analysis Questions

Informed by your design research, provide brief answers to the following
questions. These should help you begin to identify tasks essential to your
design.

1. Who is going to use the design?
2. What tasks do they now perform?
3. What tasks are desired?
4. How are the tasks learned?
5. Where are the tasks performed?
6. What is the relationship between the person and data?
7. What other tools does the person have?
8. How do people communicate with each other?
9. How often are the tasks performed?
10. What are the time constraints on the tasks?
11. What happens when things go wrong?

#### Submission

No more than four pages of text in PDF format, to include:

- Summary of key findings or takeaways (one paragraph at beginning).
- Design research participants (one or two paragraphs).
- Eight specific design research findings (less than two pages).
- Discussion of at least two themes or high-level insights distilled across
  findings (one or two paragraphs).
- Task analysis questions (less than two pages).

Submit via your git repo.

#### In Class

Be prepared to discuss your design research.

Bring several printed copies of your submission (e.g., four),
so that you can easily present them to peers for critique.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __13 points__:

1. __Description of Participants__ : (2 points)
2. __Specific Findings__ : (8 x .5 points)
2. __Quality of Themes Developed__: (2 points)
3. __Answers to Task Analysis Questions__: (3 points)
4. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

### Assignment 2.E: Task Development

The goal of this milestone is to develop a set of tasks that you will explore in
a set of potential designs.

Building on what you learned in your design research, design __six tasks__ that
you believe are important to your design goal:

- Remember that tasks say what is accomplished, while leaving open how to
  accomplish it.
- Select tasks to capture the important aspects of the problem you are solving
  and to provide coverage of designs you will explore.
- Create tasks based on your observations and analyses of existing tasks (i.e.,
  tasks people already do) as well as your vision for new tasks (i.e., tasks
  that will be enabled by your potential designs).
- These should be real world tasks that include details (e.g., instead of
  "programming a DVR", details like "programming a DVR to record Spongebob on
  Sundays"). Such details can then be explored in scenarios with the potential
  designs you will develop in later milestones.
- Tasks should not have any specific relation to the potential designs you will
  develop in later milestones. Although it can be helpful to describe a task in
  the context of a specific scenario, the task itself should be more general and
  potentially achieved using multiple potential designs.
- Your six tasks should span a wide range of functionality and difficulty.

Each task should be presented as a bolded sentence at the beginning of a
paragraph, concisely conveying a problem and/or what is accomplished. The
remainder of the paragraph should then present additional details, potential
scenarios, or a step-by-step walkthrough with specific designs.

As you progress in your project, you can and should consider revising your
tasks. Expect to refine or change your tasks as your understanding of the
problem matures or according to feedback you receive. The tasks you develop in
this milestone therefore must be appropriate but are not necessarily final.

#### Submission

No more than two pages of text in PDF format, to include:

- Six task descriptions (one paragraph each).

Submit via your github repo.

#### In Class

Be prepared to discuss your design research and tasks.

Bring several printed copies of your submission (e.g., four),
so that you can easily present them to peers for critique.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __8 points__:

1. __Each of 6 Tasks__: (6 x 1 points)
2. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

### Assignment 2.F: Developing Design Ideas

The goal of this milestone is to develop distinct design ideas that address your
tasks.

You have identified and described six important tasks for your design problem.
You will now brainstorm and sketch three very different __initial designs__ for
your interface:

 - Each design should support four of your tasks, but they do not necessarily
   need to all support the same four tasks.
 - Sketch key aspects needed to illustrate the functionality in your four tasks.
   A design may imply additional tasks, but do not illustrate the entire design.
 - These should be rough sketches (i.e., not digital mockups), including
   illustrations of their relations (e.g., arrows showing transitions and
   relationships).

The purpose of these sketches is to explore the design space before you lock
yourself into a single design. They must demonstrate significant consideration
of substantially different approaches to your problem.

After receiving critique on TBA, update your designs ahead of additional
critique on TBA.

#### Submission

No more than three pages of text in PDF format, to include:

- Six task descriptions (one paragraph each, updated as needed from prior
  assignment). These should be updated according to feedback and any evolution
  in your understanding.
- For each of three initial designs:
  - The high-level idea of the design (one paragraph).
  - Images of the design (sketches, not digital mockups).
  - How to complete each of the four sketched tasks (e.g., a list of steps, one
    or two sentences per task).

Submit via your git repo.

#### In Class

Be prepared to discuss your designs.

Bring several printed copies of your submission (e.g., four), so that you can
easily present them to peers for critique.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __10 points__:

1. __Six Task Descriptions__: (2 points)

   These should be updated according to feedback and any evolution in your
   understanding.

2. __Each Design is Substantially Different and Clearly Communicated__: (3 x 2 points)
3. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

### Assignment 2.G: Design Idea Proposal

The goal of this milestone is to choose a design idea to pursue in the remainder
of this course.

From your design sketches, select one design that you will refine in the
remainder of this course. Then select two tasks that will be the focus of your
design refinement. The selected tasks need to be representative of the
experience of using your design. They should be non-trivial, critical to solving
your problem, and should emphasize long-lived or repeated activities. In
contrast, a one-time login screen for a social networking application is not
worth being the focus of your project, does not define your project
functionality, and is not sufficiently interesting.

Prepare one paragraph describing _why you selected the design_ and _why you
selected the tasks_ you did. Draw upon feedback from critiques and data from
your design research.

 - Why this design and these tasks?
 - What makes the design better suited to the people for whom you are targeting
   your design?
 - Why are these tasks more compelling than the others?

Convey a strong understanding of which design you chose, which tasks you chose,
and why you chose them.

Then _create a storyboard of each task_ for your selected design. Storyboards
should clearly indicate the functionality of the design and what it will be
like, conveying the major aspects of the design in enough detail that a person
not in your group can understand how the design supports each task. They should
establish motivation and satisfaction, should show insight into the task and
design, and should include one or more characters and settings. To ensure
clarity of your story, storyboards should not include any unneeded frames or
unnecessary details across multiple frames. As needed, ensure clarity of your
story through captions, other brief descriptions, selective use of color, or
other techniques.

#### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format, to include:

 - Discussion of your design and task choices (one paragraph).
 - Images of your storyboards and associated captions or descriptions.

Submit via your git repo.

#### In Class

Be prepared to discuss your chosen design and storyboards.

Bring several printed copies of your submission (e.g., four),
so that you can easily present them to peers for critique.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __8 points__:

1. __Rationale for Choosing a Design Focus and Tasks__: (2 points)
2. __Each of 2 Storyboards__: (2 x 2 points)
3. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

### Assignment 2.H: Presenting your design research

The goal of this milestone is to effectively communicate your design research in
a presentation.

Prepare a presentation of your process in getting the right design. It should
encompass all of your work in Assignment 2.

- Every member of your team should deliver the presentation, each speaking to
  relatively equal portions.
- Presenters should be different from those for Assignment 3, such that
  everybody presents at least once this quarter. If there is some reason this
  cannot work for your team, be sure you have communicated with us.
- A 7 minute time limit will be strictly enforced, with additional time for
  questions.

Your presentation should include:

1. __Title Slide__:

   A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.

   Include team member names. Be clear which team members are presenting.

2. __Overall Problem__:

   Convey that your problem is both important and appropriate for a design investigation.

   Motivate your audience to be interested in your problem. Consider using data
   or statistics regarding importance of the problem. Consider using a scenario
   or story to convey an emotional or human perspective on the problem. Be sure
   to avoid simply reading slide bullets, as you need to develop a connection to
   your audience.

3. __Design Research__:

   Convey what design research you conducted. This should include:
   - Your methods (i.e., what design research did you do).
   - Your participants (i.e., what participants did you engage).
   - Your key findings (i.e., what key things did you learn that will inform your design).

   Consider including images that give your audience a feeling for your work.

4. __6 Tasks__:

   Convey the breadth of tasks you have considered, in at most one sentence per task.

5. __3 Design Sketches__:

   Convey the breadth of designs you considered.

   Be clear what is the key idea or difference in each of your three designs.

6. __Selected Design Storyboards and Tasks__:

   Present your storyboards, ensuring they effectively illustrate your selected design and tasks.

   Convey your rationale for choosing this as a design focus.

We strongly recommend rehearsing your presentation beforehand. For example,
arrange to practice together with another group or two, giving each other
feedback on your presentations.

Note that we have not set a required number of slides in each section of this
presentation. You can deliver your presentation using as many or as few slides
as you want, as long as your presentation successfully addresses the above
points in the allowed time.

#### Submission

Your presentation may be in PPT, PPTX, or PDF format.

To minimize switching time, we will have all presentations on a single laptop
running Microsoft Windows. You should optimize your presentation for portability
(e.g., ensure any necessary fonts are embedded). If we detect any obvious
formatting issues on the presentation machine, we may fix them or contact you to
fix them. But you are ultimately responsible for your presentation.

Submit your presentation via your git repo.

#### Grading

The content of this presentation will be graded on a scale of __16 points__:

- Presentations should not have an outline slide.
  They are short enough to be told as a story of your process, and your outline is the same as every other presentation.
  Instead use that time to tell us about your project.
- The problem should be presented in a manner that is compelling and achievable.
- Design research should be carried out and presented in an appropriate manner.
  This should include methods, participants, and key findings.
- Tasks should provide coverage of envisioned functionality and be motivated by the design research.
- Design ideas should be distinct and have a connection to results of design research.
- The selected design and task storyboards should be compelling and have a connection to results of design research.
- Presentations should show appropriate preparation,
  with slides that are legible and content that is effective, properly prepared, and properly employed.
- Presentations should cover the required scope within the allowed time.

The delivery of this presentation will be graded on a scale of __4 points__:

- Presenter makes eye contact with the audience.
- Presenter projects their voice well and is audible throughout the room.
- Presenter feels engaged with the content, not just reading slides.
- Presenter covers the required scope within the allowed time.

# 3: Getting the Design Right

## Overview

Now that you have chosen a design, it is time to iteratively refine that design.
This group assignment, spanning multiple weeks of the course, tackles the
problem of getting the design right through __paper prototyping__,
__inspection__, and __usability testing__. Design refinement culminates in a
__digital mockup__.

## Milestones and Deliverables

This is a group assignment, consisting of six milestones.

### Assignment 3.A: Initial Paper Prototype

The goal of this milestone is to develop an initial paper prototype that will
begin to allow testing of your design.

Develop a paper prototype for your design. It should convey critical components
of your design, including support for testing your two primary tasks.

- Include an overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.
- The prototype should be complete for each task,
  including enough detail to show how to complete each step in the task.
  This should include the desired / expected / intended path, but also likely error conditions
  (e.g., what happens if some participant input is invalid?).
- The prototype should be at an appropriate level of detail,
  supporting understanding of critical components of your design and the context of the your primary tasks.
- The documentation in your report should explain how the components of your prototype are related.
  This should include detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.

This prototype has been informed by your prior sketching and storyboarding. But
it also contains more details than your prior exploratory designs. If necessary
or appropriate, revise your tasks or scenarios based on what you learn in
prototyping.

If you use an informal drawing tool, you will need to have physical copies of
your paper prototype throughout upcoming milestones. In addition,  you will need
to able to provide a PDF version for submission. You will also need the ability
to quickly iterate on your paper prototype.

#### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format, to include:

- An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.
- Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.

Submit via your git repo.

#### In Class

Bring your paper prototype to class.
You will need it to conduct a heuristic evaluation during class.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __10 points__:

1. __Overall Completeness and Appropriateness of Paper Prototype__: (2 points)

   Include an overview image.

   Include enough detail to support understanding of
   critical components of your design and the context of your primary tasks.

2. __Completeness, Appropriateness, and Documentation of Each Task__: (2 x 3 points)

   Include each step in the task, with enough detail to show how to complete each step.

3. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

### Assignment 3.B: Heuristic Evaluations

The goal of this milestone is to conduct heuristic evaluations as part of
rapidly iterating on your paper prototype.

You will receive an evaluation in class, and you will supplement this with
another evaluation.

In class, pair with another team to conduct heuristic evaluations. One team will
conduct a heuristic evaluation of the other’s paper prototype, then the two
teams will reverse roles. Each team will therefore conduct and receive one
heuristic evaluation.

We will provide a worksheet with [Nielsen's heuristics](includes/lectures/3b-nielsen-heuristics.pdf)

For each issue identified in evaluation, record:
- The heuristic that is violated.
- A description of the usability issue, including an image of the relevant portion of the prototype.
- A severity rating (ranging from 0 for _no problem_ to 4 for _usability catastrophe_).

Revise your paper prototype based on what you learn in heuristic evaluation.
Your tasks and scenarios are likely stable, but revise them if your evaluation
reveals a need.

Outside of class, arrange to receive a second heuristic evaluation (e.g., with
another team). You therefore received two heuristic evaluations of your paper
prototype. If desired, you may also conduct a heuristic evaluation or cognitive
walkthrough of your own paper prototype.

#### Submission and Grading

Records of your inspection-based methods will be submitted as part of later
assignments (eg., see Assignment 3c).

Be sure to keep detailed records, including images of relevant portions of the
prototype before and after revisions.

Submit via your git repo.

### Assignment 3.C: Changes based on inspection-based analyses

The goal of this milestone is to document changes resulting from your
inspection-based analyses and to begin usability testing of your revised
prototype with participants.

Complete one usability test with your paper prototype, examining your two
primary tasks.

Target an appropriate participant based on your design research and resulting
design.

Be sure to divide your team into roles when conducting a usability test. There
is simply too much required for a single person to effectively conduct a test.
As discussed in class, roles include the facilitator, the computer, and one or
more observers.

As part of your introduction, have your facilitator show the participant how to
interact with your design. Do not show participants how to perform your tasks
that you will later test. Instead show them how paper prototyping works, how
your system generally works, and give an example of something specific that is
sufficiently different from your tasks.

During the test, record a log of critical incidents, including both positive and
negative events. For example, a person might comment on something they like or
might make a mistake in a task. Record the incident along with a description of
the context of the incident.

Consider recording your tests to allow you to see and show exactly what
happened. If you do this, obtain permission from the participant and ensure your
recording preserves the anonymity of the participant. Frame your shot such that
you capture interaction with the prototype without unnecessarily capturing the
participant.

Each participant should perform both of your primary tasks. Keep the data
separate for each participant and each task. Remember participation must be
voluntary, participants should be free to stop at any time, and you should
emphasize that your focus is on identifying usability issues in the design.

Revise your paper prototype based on what you learn in usability testing. This
can and should include fixing major issues as soon as they are detected, before
additional tests. Your tasks and scenarios are likely stable, but revise them if
your evaluation reveals a need.

Present your iterative revisions and your plan going forward:

- Present a table or list of results from your inspection-based methods.
  We expect you will report at least **four** identified issues and resulting revisions, which may be small or large.
  You may report more, but this is the expected minimum.
  For each identified issue, include:
  - The heuristic that is violated.
  - A description of the usability issue, including an image of the relevant portion of the prototype.
  - A severity rating (ranging from 0 for _no problem_ to 4 for _usability catastrophe_).
  - An image and explanation of any revision implemented as a result.
    If you highlight an issue without revising in response to it, provide explanation of that decision.

- Discuss your first usability test.
  - Provide a description of your testing method and participant
    (e.g., the participant, the environment where you conducted the test,
    why you chose this participant and environment, the test protocol,
    and the roles of each team member who participated in the test).
  - Discuss anything you learned about the testing process itself.
    This should include at least one part of your method that was especially effective
    or one revision you decided you need to make to your testing process.

- Present a table or list of results from your first usability test.
  We expect you will report at least **two** identified incidents, which may be small or large.
  You may report more, but this is the expected minimum.
  For each critical incident, include:
  - An image of the relevant portion of the prototype.
  - Description of the incident, remembering that these can be either positive or negative.
  - For negative incidents, a severity rating (ranging from 0 for _no problem_ to 4 for _usability catastrophe_).
  - For negative incidents, an image and explanation of any revision implemented as a result.
  - For positive incidents, describe what was learned from this incident.

- Submit detailed images of your current paper prototype, as revised in this process.
  Your design may have changed more or less,
  so this is intended to fully convey the current state of your design.
  As before, ensure your prototype is complete, is at an appropriate level of detail, and documents each task.
  Include both:
  - An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.
  - Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.

- Present your plan for the remainder of your usability tests.  Describe what
  goals you have for the additional tests and any new approaches you will
  employ. You will conduct one usability test in section,  describe your plans
  for recruiting an additional participant.

As you assemble this documentation of the iterative improvement of your design,
you may find that some changes feel minor relative to the overhead of
documenting those changes. Your goals in this documentation are to:

- Show your work in the iterative design process, giving enough insight to understand your progress.
- Capture a record to which you can return in preparing your web content and presentation.

You may choose to not fully document minor changes, but be sure to document
enough for these two goals.

#### Submission

No more than three pages of text in PDF format.

Submit via your git repo.

Be prepared to discuss your iterative revision of your paper prototype.

#### In Class

Bring both your submission and your paper prototype to section.
You will need your paper prototype to conduct a usability test during section.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __13 points__:

1. __Issues Identified from Inspection, Revisions Made in Response__: (4 x 1 points)

   Include the heuristic that is violated,
   a description and image of the issue, a severity rating, and any revision.

2. __Discussion of Usability Test and Plan__: (2 points)

   Describe your participant, environment, your rationale for both, your test
   protocol, and the roles of each team member.

   Discuss what you learned about your testing process itself.

3. __Issues Identified in Usability Test, Revisions Made in Response__: (2 x 1 points)

   Include an image of the relevant portion of the prototype and a description
   of the incident.

   For negative incidents, include a severity rating and any revision.

   For positive incidents, describe what was learned from this incident.

4. __Updated Images of Paper Prototype__: (3 points)

   Include an overview image.

   Include enough detail to support understanding of critical components of your
   design and the context of your primary tasks.

   Include each step in the task, with enough detail to show how to complete
   each step.

5. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

### Assignment 3.D: Usability Testing 

The goal of this milestone is to complete usability testing of your prototype
with participants.

Complete a total of at least three usability tests and finalize your paper
prototype according to what you learn.

Present the results of your usability testing and your final paper prototype:

- Discuss your three usability tests.
  - Provide a description of your testing method and participant
    (e.g., the participant, the environment where you conducted the test,
    why you chose this participant and environment, the test protocol,
    and the roles of each team member who participated in the test).
  - Briefly discuss anything you learned about the testing process itself.
    This should include at least one part of your method that was especially effective
    or one revision you decided to make to your testing process.

- Present a table or list of results from your three usability tests.
  We expect you will report at least **three** identified incidents, which may be small or large.
  You may report more, but this is the expected minimum.
  This may include incidents you previously reported from your first usability test,
  but may also be completely different in order to focus on the most important incidents you want to report.
  For each critical incident, include:
  - An image of the relevant portion of the prototype.
  - Description of the incident, remembering that these can be either positive or negative.
  - For negative incidents, a severity rating (ranging from 0 for _no problem_ to 4 for _usability catastrophe_).
  - For negative incidents, an image and explanation of any revision implemented as a result.
  - For positive incidents, describe what was learned from this incident.

- Submit detailed images of your final paper prototype, as revised in this process.
  Your design may have changed more or less,
  so this is intended to fully convey the current state of your design.
  As before, ensure your prototype is complete, is at an appropriate level of detail, and documents each task.
  Include both:
  - An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.
  - Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.

- Discuss two to four revisions that you consider to be your most salient and important modifications
  based on issues identified in inspection, usability testing, or critique.
  These may already be included in the above list, but discuss them in more detail and argue why detecting and fixing them is important to your design.

- Discuss at least one revision you made to promote inclusivity in your design.
  Describe an unintentional assumption you identified in your design, then
  describe how you revised your design to address this assumption. If you are
  unable to identify this before this submission is due, you may discuss this
  more in section and submit a revised assignment adding this.

As you assemble this documentation of the iterative improvement of your design,
you may find that some changes feel minor relative to the overhead of
documenting those changes. Your goals in this documentation are to:

- Show your work in the iterative design process, giving enough insight to
  understand your progress.
- Capture a record to which you can return in preparing your web content and
  presentation.

You may choose to not fully document minor changes, but be sure to document
enough for these two goals.

#### Submission

No more than three pages of text in PDF format.

Submit via your git repo.

#### In Class

Bring both your submission and your paper prototype to section.
You will need your paper prototype for final critique.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __16 points__:

1. __Discussion of Usability Tests__: (2 points)

   Describe your participant, environment, your rationale for both, your test
   protocol, and the roles of each team member.

   Discuss what you learned about your testing process itself.

2. __Issues Identified in Usability Tests, Revisions Made in Response__: (3 x 1 points)

   Include an image of the relevant portion of the prototype and a description
   of the incident.

   For negative incidents, include a severity rating and any revision.

   For positive incidents, describe what was learned from this incident.

3. __Updated Images of Paper Prototype__: (3 points)

   Include an overview image.

   Include enough detail to support understanding of critical components of your
   design and the context of your primary tasks.

   Include each step in the task, with enough detail to show how to complete
   each step.

4. __Discussion of Key Revisions in Design Process__: (2 x 2 points or 4 x 1 points)

   Convey your most important modifications and why detecting and fixing them
   has been important.

   If you discuss fewer examples, provide justification and explanation of that
   focus.

5. __Discussion of Revisions to Promote Inclusivity__: (4 points)

   Include an identified assumption, the revision, and how it addresses the
   assumption.

6. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

### Assignment 3.E: Digital Mockup

The goal of this milestone is to transition your prototype into a digital mockup
of your design.

Create your digital mockup based on your final paper prototype. Do not begin
working in digital prototyping until you finish revising your paper prototype.
It is much easier to iterate on your design in the paper prototyping phase.

As you transition into digital prototyping, you will need to consider other
aspects of the design. This can include detail you may not have previously
considered (e.g., visual design, layout, color, typography), but can also
include constraints or mismatches introduced by the technology itself. Note
decisions or changes you need to make as you transition from paper to a digital
representation.

The mockup should effectively communicate your design in a manner appropriate
for your web content, presentation, and poster. Implement your digital mockup to
include key frames that illustrate your design. It should convey all critical
aspects of your design, including walkthroughs for your two primary tasks.

We have no strong preference regarding what digital tools you use to create your
mockup. But it must be digital (e.g., you may not use pictures of a hand-drawn
sketch). Some tools support creation of interactive mockups (e.g., allow
clicking active regions to move between screens). You are welcome to use such a
tool, and such interactivity may be helpful. But interactive mockups are neither
expected nor required.

Figma is a widely-used web-based collaborative tool:

 - [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

Other commonly-used tools include:

 - [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)
 - [Adobe XD](http://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)
 - [Axure](http://www.axure.com/)
 - [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
 - [Indigo Studio](http://www.infragistics.com/products/indigo-studio)
 - [InkScape](http://www.inkscape.org/en/)
 - [Microsoft Visio](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio/)
 - [Omnigraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle)
 - [Vectr](https://vectr.com/)

Present your digital mockup together with discussion of the decisions and
changes you made:

- Submit detailed images of your digital mockup. Include both:
  - Overview images that show your digital mockup.
  - Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.

- Discuss decisions and changes you made in implementing the digital mockup.
  - We expect you will report at least **three** decisions or changes you made, which may be small or large.
    You may report more, but this is the expected minimum.
  - Describe each decision or change in a few sentences,
    including why the change was necessary or desired.
    Include images to be sure it is easy to understand the decision or change.

As you assemble this documentation of the iterative improvement of your design,
you may find that some changes feel minor relative to the overhead of
documenting those changes. Your goals in this documentation are to:

- Show your work in the iterative design process, giving enough insight to understand your progress.
- Capture a record to which you can return in preparing your web content and presentation.

You may choose to not fully document minor changes, but be sure to document
enough for these two goals.

#### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format.

Submit via your git repo.

Be prepared to discuss your digital mockup and revisions that occurred in its creation.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __14 points__:

1. __Overall Completeness and Appropriateness of Digital Mockup__: (3 points)

   Include an overview image.

   Include enough detail to support understanding of
   critical components of your design and the context of your primary tasks.

2. __Completeness, Appropriateness, and Documentation of Each Task__: (2 x 3 points)

   Include each step in the task, with enough detail to show how to complete each step.

3. __Discussion of Decisions and Changes in Implementation__: (3 x 1 points)

   Describe each decision or change and why is was necessary or desired.

   Include images to convey each decision or change.

4. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

### Assignment 3.F: Presenting your design prototype

The goal of this milestone is to effectively communicate your design prototyping
in a presentation.

Prepare a presentation of your process in getting the design right. It should
encompass all of your work in Assignment 3.

- Two members of your team should deliver the presentation, each speaking to relatively equal portions.
- Presenters should be different from those for Assignment 2, such that everybody presents at least once this quarter.
  If there is some reason this cannot work for your team, be sure you have communicated with us.
- A 7 minute time limit will be strictly enforced, with additional time for questions.

A suggested organization of this presentation is:

1. __Title Slide__:

   A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.

   Include team member names. Be clear which team members are presenting.

2. __Overall Problem__:

   Convey that your problem is both important and appropriate for a design investigation.

   Motivate your audience to be interested in your problem and your proposed solution.
   Remember that you are teaching us what you learned in your process, you are not "selling" your solution.
   Be sure to avoid simply reading slide bullets, as you need to develop a connection to your audience.

3. __Initial Paper Prototype__:

   Present your initial paper prototype.
   Convey the critical aspects of your design, including the two primary tasks being refined in your paper prototype.

4. __Testing Process__:

   Present your process for iteratively improving your design, including:
   - your methods (i.e., what methods did you use to improve your initial design),
   - your participants (i.e., what participants did you engage).

5. __Testing Results and Prototype Refinement__:

   Present usability and design issues that you identified and iterative improvements you made to address those issues.
   This will include changes from your heuristic evaluation, usability testing, and design critique.

   Discuss identified issues as an appropriate level of detail, including:
   - specific usability issues that were identified and corrected (e.g., consider before and after comparisons),
   - higher-level findings and themes that emerged (e.g., consider explaining a specific issue that was identified and how it led to a larger revision of the design).

6. __Final Paper Prototype__:

   Present your final paper prototype.
   Convey the critical aspects of your design, including the two primary tasks.
   This might be shorter than your presentation of the initial paper prototype,
   because you already presented changes and are about to present the digital mockup.
   This might also have been part of your testing process and results, if changes were illustrated there.

7. __Digital Mockup__:

   Present your digital mockup.
   Convey the critical aspects of your design, including the two primary tasks.
   Discuss any significant changes that were required when transitioning from a paper prototype.

We strongly recommend rehearsing your presentation beforehand. For example,
arrange to practice together with another group or two, giving each other
feedback on your presentations.

Note that we have not set a required number of slides in each section of this
presentation. You can deliver your presentation using as many or as few slides
as you want, as long as your presentation successfully addresses the above
points in the allowed time.

#### Submission

Your presentation may be in PPT, PPTX, or PDF format.

To minimize switching time, we will have all presentations on a single laptop
running Microsoft Windows. You should optimize your presentation for portability
(e.g., ensure any necessary fonts are embedded). If we detect any obvious
formatting issues on the presentation machine, we may fix them or contact you to
fix them. But you are ultimately responsible for your presentation.

Submit via your git repo.

#### Grading

The content of this presentation will be graded on a scale of __16 points__:

- Presentations should not have an outline slide.
  They are short enough to be told as a story of your process, and your outline is the same as every other presentation.
  Instead use that time to tell us about your project.
- The problem and your proposed solution should be presented in a manner that is compelling,
  should teach us what you learned in your process rather than "selling" your solution.
- The initial prototype should be effectively conveyed through two scenarios.
- The process of iteratively improving the design should be effectively conveyed and appropriate for the design.
- Findings and iterative improvements of the design should be effectively conveyed.
- The final design, as represented by your digital mockup, should be effectively conveyed through two scenarios.
- Presentations should show appropriate preparation,
  with slides that are legible and content that is effective, properly prepared, and properly employed.
- Presentations should cover the required scope within the allowed time.

The delivery of this presentation will be graded on a scale of __4 points__:

- Presenter makes eye contact with the audience.
- Presenter projects their voice well and is audible throughout the room.
- Presenter feels engaged with the content, not just reading slides.
- Presenter covers the required scope within the allowed time.

# Assignment 4: Communicating Your Design

## Overview

You have identified a problem, explored a design space, selected a promising
design, and iterated on that design. It is now time to focus on communicating
your design and your design process. This group assignment communicates your
design through a __web post__ and through a __poster__ with an associated
__pitch__.

## Milestones and Deliverables

This is a group assignment, consisting of five milestones.

### Assignment 4.A: Web Portfolio

The goal of this milestone is to effectively communicate your design and your
underlying design process in a post appropriate for a web portfolio.

Prepare a post documenting your process of getting the right design and then
getting the design right. Your prior milestones provide significant content you
can draw upon in this post, but this post is intended for an audience of future
readers reviewing your design work. Not all content from prior milestones will
be included, you should update your prior work based on feedback received
throughout your design process (e.g., re-making a design sketch or storyboard
for clarity in this communication), and you will ultimately emphasize a few key
insights that most informed your design.

Make sure all images you include are clear and legible (e.g., with appropriate
contrast). Re-make images as necessary to ensure this (e.g., by taking new
photos in better lighting, by instead using a scanner, by re-creating a piece of
a paper prototype using ink that will create a better image).

Remember that audience is important in storytelling, and be sure your post takes
a tone of "presenting" and "reflecting" on your project. You are not "selling"
the resulting design, but are instead "sharing" your work with an interested
audience. You can express enthusiasm, but do not let that enthusiasm undermine
the substance of your content.

Your post should follow the outline below. It will be authored using Markdown
and provided components for including images. Be sure to inspect and understand
the template text provided in your project directory.

1. __Title and Logo__

   A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.

   An attractive project logo. It will be used to link to your project from the main projects page.

2. __Problem and Design Overview__:

   Provide a concise statement of the problem you are addressing and a brief introduction of your design.

   This might be a single paragraph or two short paragraphs.
   You should likely include an image to help build interest.
   Your goal is to set a context and then to motivate a reader to want to continue to learn about your work.

3. __Design Research Process and Key Insights__:

   _Design Research Process_

   First provide a concise overview of your design research process in Assignment 2, including:

   - The goals of your design research (i.e., your focus, your primary need for additional understanding).
   - The methods and participants you engaged in your design research.
   - Your rationale (i.e., why you chose your specific methods and participants).

   Your goal is to set a context for the insights this process revealed.

   This might be a single paragraph.

   _3 Key Insights_

   Then provide 3 key insights from your design research process in Assignment 2.
   Your goal is to convey key insights that informed your design and how each insight is based in your design process.

   - For each insight, discuss how the insight emerged
     (e.g., how your understanding was shaped by design research,
     how your understanding was shaped by critique or feedback).
   - Use specific evidence whenever possible
     (e.g., quotes or stories from participants,
     pictures captured during observations,
     pivots in your approach or thinking that resulted from critique or feedback,
     key reasons you chose one design over alternatives,
     key reasons you combined ideas from multiple design alternatives).
   - Do not number your insights (e.g., "Insight 1", "Insight 2", "Insight 3").
     Instead give them a descriptive title (e.g., "Minimizing Burden", "Creating Social Connections")
     or consider that each paragraph could begin with a single bolded sentence summarizing the insight.
   - Use images as appropriate for conveying the insight (e.g., images from your design sketches or storyboards).

   These might each be a single paragraph with a descriptive heading.

4. __Iterative Design Process and Key Insights__:

   _Iterative Design Process_

   First provide a concise overview of your iterative design process in Assignment 3, including:

   - Your design focus (i.e., the tasks on which you focused iterative design).
   - Your process (e.g., your paper prototyping, inspection, usability testing, and digital mockup).

   Your goal is to set a context for the insights this process revealed.

   This might be a single paragraph.
   You should likely include an overview image of your paper prototype.

   _3 Key Insights_

   Then provide 3 key insights from your iterative design process in Assignment 3.
   Your goal is to convey key insights that informed your design and how each insight is based in your design process.

   - For each insight, discuss how the insight emerged
     (e.g., the state of a design element prior to the insight,
     the activity, observation, critique, or feedback that prompted you to iterate upon a design element,
     an aspect of transitioning to a digital mockup that required re-working your design)
     and how you iterated upon the design in result
     (e.g., showing a design element before and after an iteration).
   - Use specific evidence whenever possible
     (e.g., quotes from or observations of participants).
   - Do not number your insights (e.g., "Insight 1", "Insight 2", "Insight 3").
     Instead give them a descriptive title (e.g., "Simplifying Data Collection", "Improving Legibility", "Removing Gender Assumptions")
     or consider that each paragraph could begin with a single bolded sentence summarizing the insight.
   - Use images as appropriate for conveying the insight (e.g., images from your paper prototyping or digital mockup).

   These might each be a single paragraph with a descriptive heading.

5. __Resulting Design__:

   Present key elements of your final design.
   Convey the critical aspects of your design,
   including the two primary tasks demonstrated in your digital mockup
   (e.g., as scenarios demonstrating the task with images from your digital mockup).

   This section may primarily be a set of images,
   but be sure you organize those images with enough text for a reader to understand the resulting design.

#### Submission

Evidence from Medium suggests that effective posts can be read in approximately
7 minutes:

[https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b](https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b)

Author your post such that it conveys the necessary content while remaining easy
to skim and read within approximately 7 minutes. We estimate posts will be
between 1500 and 2000 words in length.

Submit your makrdown file via your git repo.

#### Grading

Your post should be complete for critique and feedback, but only the final
version will be graded.

### Assignment 4.C: Poster Pitch

The goal of this milestone is to create a poster and a pitch that communicate
your design to a broad audience.

Create a poster that communicates your design and your design process. Present
your work in a visual form that quickly conveys its most important aspects. Your
poster should include:

- Project Title
- Logo
- Your Names
- Problem
- Value Proposition
- Key Functionality
- Key Design Insights

Your poster should emphasize images and include limited amounts of text. For
consistency and ease of display, it should be 32"x40" (i.e., portrait,
vertical).

The staff have assembled several templates you can use as a starting point:

- [Powerpoint Template A](includes/lectures/poster-template-a-32x40.pptx)
- [Powerpoint Template B](includes/lectures/poster-template-b-32x40.pptx)
- [Powerpoint Template C](includes/lectures/poster-template-c-32x40.pptx)

You should heavily modify the template to be unique and represent your project.

Make sure all images you include are clear and legible (e.g., with appropriate
contrast). Re-make images as necessary to ensure this (e.g., by taking new
photos in better lighting, by instead using a scanner, by re-creating a piece of
a paper prototype using ink that will create a better image).

During the final poster session, your team will give a one minute pitch to a
small group of judges. Create a pitch that summarizes the problem and your
design. This pitch should convince an audience that your problem was worth
investigating and that your design suggests a compelling direction.

#### Submission

Due to challenges that frequently arise in printing, submit both:

- A PDF of your poster.
- The source file for your poster (e.g., a PPTX file, a text file containing a Figma link with edit access).

Submit via your git repo.

#### In Class

We will bring 8.5"x11" printed copies of your poster to class. You will need
these for in-class critique and refinement.

#### Grading

Your poster should be complete for critique and feedback, but only the final
version will be graded. Note that grading of the final poster does allocate
points to your sufficient preparation for critique and feedback.

Critique and refinement will help further improve your poster before a final
version.

### Assignment 4.D: Poster Revisions

Appropriately revise your poster according to critique and feedback.

If you are unsure what revisions are appropriate, communicate with the course
staff well before the final poster is due.

During the final poster session, your team will give a one minute pitch to a
small group of judges. Rehearse a pitch that summarizes the problem and your
design. This pitch should convince an audience that your problem was worth
investigating and that your design suggests a compelling direction.

#### Submission

Due to challenges that frequently arise in printing, submit both:

- A PDF of your poster.
- The source file for your poster (e.g., a PPTX file, a text file containing a Figma link with edit access).

Submit via your git repo.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __12 points__:

- __Content__: (5 points)
  - Includes all of the key content listed above.
  - Key functionality of the design is clear.
  - Gives insight into the design process.
- __Clarity and Presentation__: (5 points)

### Assignment 4.E: Workshop

Come to the workshop to show off your work and engage with your classmates.
Present your pitch to a team of judges, and take the opportunity to discuss your
work with classmates and visitors while reflecting on a busy and productive
quarter.

#### Grading

The poster session will be graded only as part of participation.
We intentionally will not conduct any evaluation at the poster session itself.
