In this course we will be discussing the theoretical design and the
practical implementation of functional programming languages.  These
type of languages allow us to study programming language features from
a wide range of programming languages in a simplified setting.  We
will also be learning the functional programming language Haskell, as
well as some interesting extensions of Haskell.
