## Description

In this course we will be discussing the theoretical design and the
practical implementation of functional programming languages.  These
type of languages allow us to study programming language features from
a wide range of programming languages in a simplified setting.  We
will also be learning the functional programming language Haskell, as
well as some interesting extensions of Haskell.
